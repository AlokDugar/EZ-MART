    <section id="about">
        <p>An online shopping system that permits a customer to submit online orders for items and/or services from a
            virtual store. The system accepts the customer's submission of a purchase order for the item. The customer
            can go online and make changes to the order. When ordering goods, the shopping system will provide a virtual
            shopping cart for holding items selected for purchase. Items selected for purchase are placed into the
            virtual shopping cart until the customer checks out. Virtual shopping carts may be examined at any time, and
            their contents can be edited or deleted at the option of the customer.</p>
        <p>Shopping is considered as a recreational activity by many and hence, even so online shopping. The goal of
            this project is to develop a web based online shop. The system will be easy-to-use and user-friendly hence
            enhancing the pleasure of the users/customers. This is an e-commerce website that allows the user to
            purchase products online by browsing through the items stored in a database. It completely overthrows the
            conventional shopping approach. The products will have description to help the consumers learn about
            products in a detailed manner. The website will be easy to use and user friendly including features like
            shopping cart and checking out processes.</p>
        <p>In online shopping, it is expected that shoppers are more likely to associate price attractiveness and time
            saving with their intention to shop while in offline shopping, consumers are more likely to associate
            tangibility, high interactivity and enjoyment with their intention to shop.</p>
